# Write Your Readme Files Like A Pro 👨🏾‍💻

- Use `1 #` for first level title, e.g. the title of the project.
- Separate the `# symbole` and the following letter with `1 space char`, same for all the leading specialchars.

## Learning objectives: 2\# for 2nd level titles

As you may notice, use `\` to escape specialchars and use `-` for bullet point list.

## Tasks: 2\# for 2nd level titles

### Task 0 to task x: 3\# for 3rd level titles

- Task description goes here.

## Special Formating

### Inline code

For inline `code` (func prototypes and everything red), surround your code with single \` char. E.g. `void _putchar(char c);`.

### Block of code

For a block of code (multiple lines), use 3\` chars. E.g. 👇🏾
Bonus: _If you need a syntax highlight, specify the language right after the opening \`\`\`._

```c
#include <header>

/**
 * talk to betty
 */
 int main(void)
 {
    return (0);
 }
```

### Numbered list

Just use `1 everywhere` or any number you want(first num is 1).
